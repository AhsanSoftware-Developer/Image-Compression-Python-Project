# Image-Compression-Python-Project
This is a desktop application built using Python and Tkinter that allows users to efficiently compress images into JPEG and PNG formats while maintaining quality. The tool provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) where users can:

Select an image for compression.
Adjust JPEG quality (1-100) and PNG compression level (0-9) based on their preference.
Preview both the original and compressed images within the application.
Compare file sizes before and after compression to optimize storage usage.
This tool is useful for reducing image file sizes while preserving visual clarity, making it ideal for web applications, storage management, and image optimization.

Technologies Used:
Python
Tkinter (GUI)
PIL (Pillow) for image processing
OS module for file handling
